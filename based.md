Here's how you might approach C programming with just math and pointers, stripping down to the bare essentials:

Minimal C Programming with Math and Pointers
No Libraries, Just Math:
In C, even without libraries, you can perform basic arithmetic operations:

c

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 3;
    int sum = a + b;
    int diff = a - b;
    int prod = a * b;
    int quot = a / b; // integer division, watch out for remainder

    // Use pointer arithmetic to demonstrate basic math operations
    int *p = &a;
    *(p + 1) = b; // equivalent to *(p+sizeof(int)) = b if we had b right after a in memory

    return 0;
}


Pointers and Pure Math:

    Pointer Arithmetic: This is one of the core features of C when you strip away libraries. You can manipulate memory directly:


c

int main() {
    int array[3] = {1, 2, 3};
    int *ptr = array; // Points to array[0]

    // Use pointer arithmetic to move through array elements
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);     // 1
    printf("%d\n", *(ptr + 1)); // 2
    printf("%d\n", *(ptr + 2)); // 3

    // Math operations with pointers
    *(ptr + 1) += 1; // Increment the second element by 1
    printf("%d\n", *(ptr + 1)); // Now prints 3

    return 0;
}


Memory and Pointers Without Libraries:
To work without standard libraries, you'd need to interact with the system at a very low level:

    Direct Memory Access: Without functions like malloc, you might write directly to memory addresses or use static allocation:


c

#include <sys/syscall.h> // For syscalls if you're not completely avoiding headers

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int *p = &a; // pointer to a

    // Writing to screen in a very basic way (Linux-specific, very low-level)
    // Assuming we're in a system where 0xB8000 is video memory (old VGA mode)
    char *video_memory = (char*)0xB8000;
    *video_memory = 'H';  // Write 'H' at the start of video memory
    *(video_memory + 1) = 0x07; // Attribute byte for white on black

    // Use syscalls for I/O if you're not going completely library-free
    syscall(SYS_write, 1, "Hello\n", 6); // Write "Hello\n" to stdout (file descriptor 1)

    return 0;
}


Note: 

    The above code assumes a Linux environment for the syscall interface. Without any headers or libraries, you'd need to know exact memory addresses or system calls by number.
    Pointer arithmetic is vital here as you're essentially dealing with raw memory. 
    This approach is not portable and is extremely OS/hardware-specific.


Remember, this is an academic exercise to understand C at its core. Real-world programming requires libraries for efficiency, portability, and to handle complexities like file I/O, network communication, and user interaction. However, understanding this level can give you deep insights into how C interacts with hardware and memory.
